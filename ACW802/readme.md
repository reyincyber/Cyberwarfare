## [ACW802_OperationShadowStrike.pdf](https://github.com/reyincyber/Cyberwarfare/blob/main/ACW802/ACW802_OperationShadowStrike.pdf)

Operation Shadow Strike simulates a multi-phase Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaign targeting a fictional IT firm, GlobalTech Solutions. The lab comprises five critical phases: _**DDoS attack simulation, spear phishing for credential harvesting, establishing persistence via backdoors, lateral movement across networked systems, and encrypted data exfiltration**_. Each phase demonstrates offensive techniques and reflects on associated defensive strategies. The lab highlights challenges faced during execution, including tool setup issues, and concludes with recommendations to enhance cybersecurity posture through endpoint detection, segmentation, and data loss prevention measures.

## [ACW802_FlareVM_SetUp.pdf](https://github.com/reyincyber/Cyberwarfare/blob/main/ACW802/ACW802_FlareVM_SetUp.pdf)

This lab outlines the setup of a Windows 10-based malware analysis environment using FLARE-VM within VirtualBox. The guide walks through step-by-step instructions to _**install VirtualBox, configure the Windows 10 ISO, disable security protections, and deploy the FLARE-VM toolkit**_. Key takeaways include the importance of isolating the analysis environment, disabling Windows Defender and automatic updates, and snapshotting at critical stages. The setup emphasizes safety and operational integrity for conducting reverse engineering and malware experimentation tasks.
