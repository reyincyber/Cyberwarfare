## [ACW801	Fundamentals of Cyber Warfare](https://github.com/reyincyber/Cyberwarfare/tree/4c6bd8a2a755e326f6d6ce46493cdb902ece0714/ACW801)

The [ACW801 folder](https://github.com/reyincyber/Cyberwarfare/tree/4c6bd8a2a755e326f6d6ce46493cdb902ece0714/ACW801) is a comprehensive collection of research, strategic analysis, and policy recommendations focused on cyber warfare, offensive cyber operations, and international cyber law. As part of the ICDFA Advanced Cyberwarfare Program, these reports provide in-depth technical, geopolitical, and legal insights into modern cyber conflicts. It includes the following resources

ðŸ“„ [1: Dissecting Stuxnet - Anatomy of a Cyber Weapon](https://github.com/reyincyber/Cyberwarfare/blob/main/ACW801/ACW801_L1%20-%20Dissecting%20Stuxnet%20Anatomy%20of%20a%20Cyber%20Weapon.pdf)

ðŸ“„ [2: Strategic Cyber Operation Report - Operation Shadow Strike](https://github.com/reyincyber/Cyberwarfare/blob/main/ACW801/ACW801_L2_Strategic%20Cyber%20Operation%20Report-Operation%20Shadow%20Strike.pdf); PowerPoint: [Operation Shadow Strike](https://github.com/reyincyber/Cyberwarfare/blob/main/ACW801/ACW801_%20Operation%20Shadow%20Strike%20Slides.pptx)

ðŸ“„ [3: International Cyber Warfare Laws & Ethics](https://github.com/reyincyber/Cyberwarfare/blob/main/ACW801/ACW801_L3_International%20Cyber%20Warfare%20Laws%20and%20Ethics.pdf)

ðŸ“„ [Policy Memo: Preventing Future Cyber Weapons Escalation](https://github.com/reyincyber/Cyberwarfare/blob/main/ACW801/Policy%20Memo%20Recommending%20Safeguards%20To%20Prevent%20Future%20Cyber%20Weapons%20Escalation.pdf)

## [ACW802	Offensive Cyber Operations](https://github.com/reyincyber/Cyberwarfare/tree/main/ACW802)

The [ACW802	directory](https://github.com/reyincyber/Cyberwarfare/tree/main/ACW802) contains hands-on lab documentation and practical exercises, focusing on offensive cybersecurity operations and malware analysis environments. The labs are designed to simulate real-world attack scenarios and prepare environments for advanced threat analysis and penetration testing.

ðŸ“„ [ACW803_Dynamic Malware Analysis: Behavioral Profiling of a Suspicious Executable](https://github.com/reyincyber/Cyberwarfare/blob/main/ACW802/ACW802_Dynamic%20Malware%20Analysis_lab.pdf), [YouTube](https://youtu.be/b-Djcp9XBGI?si=2lPczp1wxMJOMNlB)

## [ACW803	Defensive Cyber Operations](https://github.com/reyincyber/Cyberwarfare/blob/main/ACW803_Operation%20Blacktrace_Lab1.pdf)
Operation Blacktrace investigates a stealthy breach at ICDFAâ€™s internal network, where a malicious PACP (Packet Capture) file redirected internal traffic to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker exfiltrated data, escalated privileges using stolen credentials, and conducted internal reconnaissance without deploying malware. This case underscores the risks of fileless attacks and highlights the need for network segmentation, anomaly-based detection, and hardened proxy configurations.

## [ACW804	Cyber Warfare in Critical Infrastructure](https://github.com/reyincyber/Cyberwarfare/blob/main/ACW804_CyberWarfare%20in%20Crititical%20Infrastructure.pdf)
This strategic lab assesses the national security risks of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure (CI), including energy grids, healthcare systems, and financial networks. It explores nation-state motivations, real-world attacks like Industroyer2, and outlines a comprehensive resilience framework. The document emphasizes Zero Trust, threat modeling, OT security, cross-sector collaboration, and rapid response capabilities to defend against state-sponsored campaigns.
