ðŸ“„ [ACW803_Dynamic Malware Analysis: Behavioral Profiling of a Suspicious Executable](https://github.com/reyincyber/Cyberwarfare/blob/main/ACW802/ACW802_Dynamic%20Malware%20Analysis_lab.pdf), [YouTube](https://youtu.be/b-Djcp9XBGI?si=2lPczp1wxMJOMNlB)

## [ACW803	Defensive Cyber Operations](https://github.com/reyincyber/Cyberwarfare/blob/main/ACW803_Operation%20Blacktrace_Lab1.pdf)
Operation Blacktrace investigates a stealthy breach at ICDFAâ€™s internal network, where a malicious PACP (Packet Capture) file redirected internal traffic to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker exfiltrated data, escalated privileges using stolen credentials, and conducted internal reconnaissance without deploying malware. This case underscores the risks of fileless attacks and highlights the need for network segmentation, anomaly-based detection, and hardened proxy configurations.

## [ACW804	Cyber Warfare in Critical Infrastructure](https://github.com/reyincyber/Cyberwarfare/blob/main/ACW804_CyberWarfare%20in%20Crititical%20Infrastructure.pdf)
This strategic lab assesses the national security risks of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure (CI), including energy grids, healthcare systems, and financial networks. It explores nation-state motivations, real-world attacks like Industroyer2, and outlines a comprehensive resilience framework. The document emphasizes Zero Trust, threat modeling, OT security, cross-sector collaboration, and rapid response capabilities to defend against state-sponsored campaigns.

## [ACW901 â€“ Cyber Warfare Analysis](https://github.com/reyincyber/Cyberwarfare/tree/main/ACW901)
This module delivers a comprehensive assessment of cyber warfare strategies, operational tactics, and their implications in modern defense and national security. The content includes a detailed written report and presentation slides, covering threat actor profiling, operational impact forecasting, and resilience recommendations. Designed for both strategic planners and cybersecurity practitioners, ACW901 bridges theoretical frameworks with real-world case studies to enhance understanding of cyber operations in conflict scenarios.

## [ACW902 â€“ Nation-State Cyber Operations - Operation BLACK FOG](https://github.com/reyincyber/Cyberwarfare/blob/main/ACW902%20Operation%20BLACK%20FOG%20%E2%80%93%20OPSPORTAL%20v2.1.4.pdf)
This lab simulates a nation-state-level cyber operation targeting the OPSPORTAL v2.1.4 logistics command system. Through advanced web exploitation, including SQL Injection and misconfiguration analysis, the assessment uncovered critical vulnerabilities leading to credential leaks, exposed cryptographic keys, and database compromise. The exercise demonstrates real-world APT methodologies spanning reconnaissance, exploitation, and data exfiltration while providing key defensive recommendations to strengthen national-level cyber resilience and critical infrastructure protection.

## [ACW903: Weaponizing Vulnerabilities - Exploit Development](https://github.com/reyincyber/Cyberwarfare/tree/main/ACW903)
ACW903 examines the full exploit-development lifecycle: from fuzzing and crash triage to PoC creation, payload construction, and advanced bypasses (ROP/ret2libc) used to defeat DEP/NX and ASLR. The module blends hands-on techniques with real-world case studies (EternalBlue, Baron Samedit) to show how multiple bugs are chained into reliable exploits and what defenders must doâ€”patching, memory hardening, EDR and layered mitigationsâ€”to raise the attackerâ€™s cost.

## [ACW904 â€“ Operation AEGIS SHIELD](https://github.com/reyincyber/Cyberwarfare/blob/main/ACW904_%20Operation%20AEGIS%20SHIELD.pdf)
Operation *AEGIS SHIELD* simulates a full-scale defensive cyber operation under live adversary conditions, focusing on real-time command decision-making, containment, and intelligence escalation. The exercise follows the cyber kill chain from delivery to command-and-control, detailing the defense against the IRON VORTEX threat groupâ€™s attempted intrusion on the POSEIDON Maritime Logistics Network. Through structured injects, forensic response, and situational reporting, the module highlights the integration of active defense, evidence preservation, and operational leadership within a nation-state cyber defense framework.
